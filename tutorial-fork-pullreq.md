# Tutorial Assignment for forking and pull requests in GitHub
Source:  - https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/
## Goals: Learn to edit a file collaboratively
- Learn how to "fork" a folder of files from GitHub to your own computer so you can work with it
- Refresh your skills on writing in Markdown
- Collaborate on a set of notes on Linebaugh and Rediker's Many Headed Hydra
- Refresh your skills on 'commits' in GitHub
- Learn how to send a "pull request" to the master file.

## Fork the repository (folder)

- Log into GitHub and go to http://github.com/Garrigus. Find the "tutorial-forking-pullreq" repository.
- Click on the "fork" button in the upper right hand corner. This copies the files in the repository into your GitHub account.

## Clone the repository to your computer
- Now you need to copy the files to your own computer so you can work on your own version. This is called "cloning".
- In your forked version, click on the green "Clone or Download" button on the right side of the screen
- You can do this in GitHub Desktop by choosing "Clone in Desktop". Or you can copy a zipfile to your computer and unpack it there.
- If you use the zipfile method, then "add" this new folder or repository to your GitHub Desktop list of repositories.

## Add some content to the file named "Assignment-file-HydraNotes.md"
- Open that file in a plain text editor.
- Choose one of the chapters and add 4 or 5 notes about the content of that chapter, as a bulleted list. Use Markdown format.
- You can add other content if you want -- images, links, etc.
- After you save your changes, make a "commit" that describes the changes in GitHub Desktop.
- Don't forget to "publish" your local repository(folder) and to "sync" any changes you made.

## Make a "Pull Request"
- Once you've added the content that you wanted, "committed" your changes locally, and synced those changes up to GitHub, it's time to propose that the masterfile accept your changes.
- This is called a "pull request"
- Go to your on-line account in GitHub, and find your forked repository
- Click on the the green button labeled "Compare and pull request"
- This will take you to a page where you can describe your changes and make a case that they should be included in the masterfile.
- Then click on "Send pull request". This will submit your change to the owner of the masterfile, Dr. Garrigus, and he will evaluate your work.

## Done!
- You have forked a repository, made changes, and contributed to a document!
- This is technology you can use to collaborate with other historians and/or teachers for writing, collecting data, or even programming.
